## About the Project

Microsoft and Adaptive Biotechnologies are exploring how the immune system responds to COVID-19. As part of this project, they are gathering AIRR-seq data from COVID-19 patients and this data will be stored in Adaptive's publicly available ImmunoSeq repository. In order to make this data more broadly accessible, there is a need to convert this data from the Adaptive format to standard AIRR-seq data formats as created by the AIRR-Community.

The goal of this project is to develop a tool to query the Adaptive ImmunoSeq repository (using their Web APIs), download data, and convert it to the standard AIRR-seq data formats for Repertoires and Rearrangements.
